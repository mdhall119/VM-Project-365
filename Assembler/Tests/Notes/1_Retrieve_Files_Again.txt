February 2025

1. Open your command line and connect to the machines (ssh netid@hydra##.eecs.utk.edu)
2. Enter your password and two-factor authenticate
3. Create a directory that you will zip later (mkdir directory_name)
4. Navigate into that directory (cd directory_name)
5. Copy all of Marz's tests to that directory (cp /home/smarz1/courses/cosc365/project/tests/* .)
6. Leave that directory (cd ..)
7. Zip the directory, carefully. It should zip instantly (zip -r name.zip directory_name)
8. Open a new terminal window and copy the zip file (scp netid@hydra##.eecs.utk.edu:name.zip ./Downloads)
9. Move the zip file to your repository and unzip it
