Swap Instruction

The swap instruction will swap the four-byte values at the memory address given by the stack pointer (sp+from) and (sp+to). 
In other words, swap(sp+from, sp+to). This instruction does NOT check to make sure (sp+from) and (sp+to) are value. 
It doesnâ€™t matter which one is from and which is to. The from and to fields are both 12 bits and are signed values. 
If from is not specified, it defaults to 4, and if to is not specified, it defaults to 0.

The from and to fields are encoded using 12 bits. 
However, since the offset can only be a multiple of four, the offset is shifted two places to the right before being encoded into the 12-bit field. 
Therefore, when decoded, the machine will read these as 14-bit values, with the lower two bits cleared to 0.

The from and to fields may be specified as either decimal (base 10) or hexadecimal (base 16). Hexadecimal will be prefixed by 0x.

String Input Instruction

The stinput instruction will read a line as a string from the console (stdin). 
The maximum number of characters that can be pushed to the stack is given by a 24-bit unsigned size encoded in the instruction. 
If no number is given, the 24 bits will all be encoded with 1s (i.e., 0x00FF_FFFF). 
If more characters are given than the maximum size, they will be discarded.

If the maximum size is given, it may be specified in either decimal or hex. Hex must be prefixed with 0x.

All leading and trailing whitespace characters will be removed from the input string (not the final, pushed string). 
Leading and trailing whitespace does not count towards the maximum since it is removed before the string is pushed. 
If no string is given (e.g, the string is nothing but whitespace or is just enter), then 0 is pushed to the stack.
The string input instruction pushes a string to the stack just like String Push Instruction does.
